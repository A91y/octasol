Octasol is a cutting-edge, open-source bounty platform reimagining how open-source projects are managed on GitHub. It connects maintainers with skilled contributors worldwide, making collaboration more efficient and rewarding.

## üöÄ How It Works

### üõ†Ô∏è For Maintainers

1. **Post Issues**: Easily post issues from your GitHub repositories and attach bounties to attract skilled contributors.
2. **Escrow Setup**: During negotiations, set up an escrow through Octasol.

1. **Signal Interest**: Signal your interest by submitting blank pull requests to issues with bounties.
2. **Negotiate**: Negotiate directly with maintainers to finalize the bounty amount.
3. **Get Paid**: Upon successful merge of your pull request, receive the escrowed funds in your Solana wallet.
