## Setting Up Local Development Environment


1. Fork the Repository
1. Clone the Repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/octasol.git octasol

    cd octasol
    ```


1. Install Dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```
1. Start the Development Server

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
1. Set Up Environment Variables

    Prisma uses an environment file (.env) for database connection details. Create your own .env file.
    
    Add your database connection string:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    ```

1. Migrate the Prisma Database

    After setting up your .env file with the correct database connection, you‚Äôll need to run Prisma migrations to set up the local database schema.

    ```
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
1. Generate Prisma Client

    If it's not automatically generated during the installation or migration process, run:

    ```
    npx prisma generate
    ```

1. Start the Development Server

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Keep your repo up-to-date

> [!NOTE] 
> Keep your `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Octasol/octasol.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
> ```
>
> This adds the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," fetches the latest changes from that repo, 
>and sets your local `main` to track the upstream `main` branch. To update your `main` branch, run `git pull`. 
>Afterward, create new branches from `main` for your pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the Repository
1. Clone the Repository

     ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/octasol.git octasol

    cd octasol
    ```

1. Create a branch for your PR 

    ```
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

1. Commit, push changes to your PR 

    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Include a message about your PR"
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

1. Open [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/de/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
    * Go to your fork on GitHub, where you'll see a notification that your branch has recent pushes and an option to create a Pull Request. 
    * Click on the Compare & Pull Request button and select your branch from the "head repository" dropdown, and compare it with the main branch of the original repository.  
    * Provide a title and clear description for your pull request and which issue it fixes. 
    * Prefer async/await over promises for handling asynchronous operations, as it improves readability.

1. Pull Request Review  
    * One or more maintainers will review the changes and may request modifications. After approval, your PR will be merged into the main codebase.

> [!NOTE] 
> Respond to feedback: If the maintainer requests changes, commit those changes to the same branch. Push the updated code, and GitHub will automatically update your PR.
> Approval: Once the changes are satisfactory, the reviewer will approve the PR.

## Code Guidelines

* Use Consistent Naming Conventions
* Use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., myVariable, calculateTotal)
* Use PascalCase for class names and components (e.g., MyComponent, UserProfile).
* Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., MAX_USERS).
* Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
* Leverage TypeScript's features like interfaces, enums, and type annotations to enhance type safety.
* Use strict mode for stricter type checking ("strict": true in tsconfig.json).
* Use OOP concepts for code organization and reuse.
* Use .env.local for environment variables to separate secrets and configurations from your codebase.
* Use Tailwind‚Äôs responsive utilities to build responsive designs easily.
* Customize your theme in the tailwind.config.js file to define your own color palette, spacing, and more.
